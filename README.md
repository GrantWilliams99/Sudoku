# Sudoku - Overview

This program is an implementation of Sudoku in Python using sets. 

There are three types of sets in use. There are nine sets for each row, nine for each column, and nine for each box. This allows for quickly identifying possible answers to a given cell by cross-referencing which numbers are already in play in each of the sets. 

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* Python (3.11.4) 64-bit
* Git / GitHub

# Future Work

* The "solve" feature only implements a naive solution for Sudoku. In order to solve more difficult puzzles, a better algorithm will need to be used.
